# Enhancements

Let me explore the codebase to understand the current structure and then suggest potential additions that would enhance this universal LLM app interface.

## Caching and Rate Limiting Layer

- Implement a caching system for LLM responses to reduce API costs and latency
- Add rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
- Support different caching strategies (in-memory, Redis, etc.)

## Prompt Management System

- Version control for prompts
- A/B testing capabilities for different prompt variations
- Prompt templating with variables and inheritance
- Prompt optimization based on usage metrics

## Streaming Support

- Add streaming capabilities for all providers
- Implement progress tracking and partial response handling
- Support for websocket connections

## Input/Output Validation

- Schema validation for inputs and outputs
- Type safety across the framework
- Content moderation and filtering
- Input sanitization

## Middleware System

- Pre-processing hooks for prompts
- Post-processing hooks for responses
- Custom middleware for logging, metrics, etc.
- Error handling middleware

## Cost Management

- Budget controls and limits
- Cost estimation before requests
- Usage analytics and reporting
- Cost optimization suggestions

## Testing Framework

- Mock LLM responses for testing
- Regression testing for prompts
- Performance benchmarking
- Automated quality checks

## Observability

- Detailed logging system
- Performance metrics
- Tracing for complex operations
- Health monitoring

## Security Layer

- API key rotation
- Request signing
- Rate limiting per client
- Input validation and sanitization

## Domain Registry

- Central registry for domain implementations
- Discovery mechanism for available domains
- Versioning for domain implementations
- Domain dependency management

## Chain Management

- Simple chain orchestration
- Chain visualization
- Chain debugging tools
- Chain optimization

## Model Management

- Model version control
- Model performance tracking
- Automatic model selection based on task
- Model fallback strategies

## Content Export/Import

- Standard format for exporting/importing prompts
- Export/import of evaluation results
- Backup and restore functionality
- Integration with version control

## Integration Layer

- Webhooks for events
- REST API wrapper
- GraphQL interface
- Event bus for system events

## Documentation Generation

- Automatic API documentation
- Domain documentation
- Usage examples
- Best practices guide

These additions would make the framework more robust while maintaining its core philosophy of being lightweight and modular. Each component could be implemented as an optional module, allowing users to include only what they need.

The key is to implement these features in a way that maintains the current clean architecture and doesn't introduce unnecessary complexity. Each addition should follow the same pattern of:

1. Clear interface definition
2. Minimal implementation
3. Standard error handling
4. Consistent documentation
5. Optional inclusion

This would allow the framework to scale from simple use cases to complex applications while maintaining its ODBC-like simplicity and standardization.
