Across Earth, unexplained lights and strange phenomena appear in the night sky, baffling experts and witnesses alike. Media frenzy erupts as wild speculation runs rampant. Strange object fragments are discovered, displaying technology far beyond human capabilities.   

Our protagonists lead ordinary lives: Some are elder action stars basking in nostalgia and paying medical bills. Others are modern entertainers focused on gossip rags and social media. All seem blissfully unaware of the momentous events unfolding.

In the galactic capital of a powerful alien warrior race, a Ruling Council reviews data on what they assume are historical records of Earth's mightiest champions and decides to initiate The Gauntlet - an ancient ritual to determine if a newly discovered sentient species is worthy of being "harvested" or spared.  

##Call to Adventure
A towering, ominous alien spacecraft appears over major cities, broadcasting a message demanding champions come forth for The Gauntlet. Around the world, former action stars and modern celebrities are teleported aboard with growing panic/confusion. 

##Refusal of the Call 
Brought together on the alien craft, the humans initially react with anger, disbelief, attempts to escape and infighting, dismissing the threat as a hoax. Their disparate personalities, backgrounds, grudges and ego clashes make cooperating difficult. 

##Supernatural Aid
Kal-Vath, an alien Commander, appears and uses telepathic technology to explain the situation and share knowledge of The Gauntlet's rules and stakes. He introduces holographic recordings depicting previous Gauntlets and brutal tests that proved fatal for representatives of countless other worlds.   

##The First Threshold 
As the humans slowly grasp the catastrophic severity of their plight, the spacecraft takes them beyond the boundaries of known space/time to the Gauntlet planet - an artificial, Shape-shifting battleground that will manifest and discard infinite arenas for them to prove their worth.

##Act I Emotional Shift: From baffled denial to dawning horror at the nearly impossible challenge before them and grave threat it poses to Earth's survival.
