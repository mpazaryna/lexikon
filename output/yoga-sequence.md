#### 2. Sun Salutations (10-15 minutes)

  - **Alignment Points:** Stand on one foot, place the other foot's sole inside the standing leg's thigh. Hands in prayer position at heart center or raised above the head.
  - **Modifications:** Foot can be placed on the calf instead of the thigh but avoid the knee. Use a wall for balance if needed.

  - **Modifications:** Place a bolster under knees or a blanket under the head for comfort.
  - **Breath Guidance:** Let your breath return to its natural rhythm. Allow your body to feel heavy and relaxed.

- **Closing Meditation**
  - Remain in Savasana. Reflect on your practice and the fulfillment of your intention. Gradually bring awareness back to your breath, then to small movements in fingers and toes, awakening the body.

### Additional Considerations

- **Safety Precautions:** Always maintain alignment to prevent injury. Do not push your body beyond its limits. Use props for support and stability.
- **Props Needed:** Yoga mat, blocks, bolster, blanket.
- **Benefits:** This sequence is designed to build strength and flexibility, enhance balance, and promote a sense of inner calm.
- **Energy Flow:** The sequence starts with grounding and centering poses, builds up energy through Sun Salutations and standing poses, shifts towards introspection and focus during floor work, and ends with relaxation and meditation to integrate the practice.
